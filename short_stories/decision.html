                        "I hate her, I hate her, I hate her", I repeat to myself, watching the lights fade and the screen come alive in front of me. Already I know what's going to happen, and I'm pretty sure what's coming. There's no doubt in my mind as to what I'm about to watch.
                        Light fills the screen; the image of a cigarette being pulled from a pack.
                        No, that wasn't the worst decision of my life. Not by far.
                        I quit smoking ten years ago, and what killed me was suicide, not cancer.
                        The worst decision of my life is the hand lighting my cigarette onscreen.
                        Belonging to Linda, of course. Linda, with her long hair and her large smile, wide like you think of river streams in the Amazon forest. Wide like you think of Julia Robert's smile on her best, most intense orgasm ever.
                        Wide the way you think of the universe itself, my Linda's smile.
                        Not my. Just Linda.
                        That's the day we met, onscreen The worst decision of my life, reads the title over black.
                        The things she put me through, I think through tears and bitter thoughts -- I can't even...
                        There's her, sitting across from me on the bar table, asking my name.
                        She was always the one in control. From the start. The alpha male, that's what she was. The one who asked me out, the one who leaned in first for the kiss.
                        Linda was the first to say I love you, even though I 'm sure I started loving her first.
                        She beat me to everything.
                        The worst decision of my life, I think, eye to eyeing her from across the screen, trying to project her beautiful face and body across time to the day I found out.
                        The day I found out she was not mine anymore. The day she left me.
                        The day I -- even if unconsciously, even if metaphorically, at first -- decided to stop living.
                        The worst decision of my life, that bitch, I think, snorting chuckles between tears as she laughs and laughs and runs her hand down my arm onscreen.
                        And already, onscreen, I'm smiling, too, in my shy, little, boyish way. That's what I was, a boy.
                        She was a woman, and I was a boy.
                        Linda, with her small hands and her big heart. Linda, with the way she tucked her hair behind her ears, every time she was trying to be serious.
                        Linda, with the way she made me feel real. With the way she made me believe that life was more than just waking up a certain number of times then dying.
                        Linda, with the way she taught me that love was real, not some Disney bullshit I could write off with a couple of jokes in a humor blog.
                        The worst decision of my life, how I let myself get carried away by her, gave her my everything, and watched her take it away.
                        Linda, with the way she made me kill myself, I think, getting up just as the film ends.
                        The last image, a frozen frame of laughter, her head leaned over to my shoulder. A cigarette dangling from my lips, I almost look like a real man.
                        The man she made me. Built me from scratch, she did, then kicked me down like a castle in the sand. Linda.
                        And as I walk away from the screen, I think of the day on the roller coaster, when she grabbed my arm on the way up, and I couldn't tell if that feeling in my stomach was from the fall or just being touched by her.
                        I think of the first night we made love, and how we talked for hours after, and how I thought that, before her, I always just wanted girls to leave after fucking.
                        I think of our first year anniversary, and I think of the way she liked devil's food cake.
                        I make my way out of the theater, thinking about the fact that she loved gap years, because they were "extra time to be alive".
                        Whipping my eyes, I turn to the guy at the door, the usher, as he asks "Aren't you going to watch the second video?"
                        He asks if I'm not going to watch what the best decision of my life was.
                        "No", I reply, and already I'm in the hallway, outside the theater, and I have to scream the rest back to him.
                        "You're just gonna play the same video again."
