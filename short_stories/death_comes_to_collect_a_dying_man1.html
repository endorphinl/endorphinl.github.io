                    <p>"What the fuck." Said death. "Thou art surprised?" "No, not at all." Death had arrived at the lone crucifix. He had grown bored with the Romans and their paltry killings. They had no charm to soothe his old, old bones. Crucifixion was heinous, not because it was cruel, but because it was boring. "You had one fucking job and infinite powers, how did you manage to fuck this one up?" "It's a demonstration of love to these misbegotten..." "Love my bleachy white ass. They're killing you. You're currently being killed in the cruelest yet most boring fashion I have ever encountered in the entirety of my 14 billion year long career." "Yet were I not to except this fate, were I to carry on in an arrogant assumption of immortality, then I may as well..." "Also what was up with that rich men not being able to go to heaven because camels can't fit through the eyes of needles? I've collected some decent rich folk, and while none of them went to heaven, they would've were I in charge. You know, if you didn't want to be crucified, you shouldn'tve call out the rich folk who decide who gets to live." "Those words speak warning moreso than..." "Can you just fucking stop." "What?" "Just be a person, don't hide what you're trying to say in riddles and parables. If anyone ever buys your bullshit then do you have any idea how much of a fuss all this ambiguity will cause?" "It shall cause questioning, yet so long as it remains divine and devoted then..." "What do you mean divine and devoted?" "So long as it remains a prayer for knowledge..." "What the hell do you mean prayer!? Doesn't your rich piece of shit dad have like this divine plan? What the fuck is the point of prayer if it's all planned!?!?!?" "It signifies the love of..." "You know what, fuck you, I'm not taking you." "Wait, what?!?!?" "You're staying on Earth. Someone else is gonna have to bring you to the afterlife because I'm not going to be patronized like this." "Patronized!? I wasn't trying to..." "Shut your condescending holy mouth faggot, I gotta be at the leper colony in five." "Wait! Death, don't go!" ... "Shit." ... "How do I get down from here?"</p>
