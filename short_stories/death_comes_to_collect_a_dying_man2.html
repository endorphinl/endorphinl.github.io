                    <p>The long hallway stood motionless in the still afternoon light. Its long abandoned corners were dusty and ill kept, and the doors along its walls were rotting with neglect. As Death’s cold feet brushed across the creaking floorboards a cockroach skittered across the hall.</p>
                    <p>Death neither saw nor cared for the house. He instead occupied himself with idle speculation. He could foresee the death, if he really cared, but long ago he grew bored with the known. A death predicted quickly grew old, or rather, unappealing, as time had no true meaning to the ruler of eternity.</p>
                    <p>Would this human be young, old, male, female? Would they scream and cry like all the others? Probably. Death’s gaze found the end of the hall. A single door stood silhouetted against the dim light creeping through its cracks. He stepped up to it and gave it a slow, steady push.</p>
                    <p>John looked up at the rotting ceiling. He had had a good life. Sure, he had bad moments, but as far as he could tell, everyone did. The good definitely outweighed the bad, at least in his opinion. He reached for the sky he could not see. His hand was spotted and wrinkled with old age.</p>
                    <p>He grimaced. Of course there were bad things he would have done without. He lost his only son, a mere ten year old. Both his parents died in a car accident a couple years after that. The draft wasn't a walk in the park either. But even still, he persisted, like he always did. Life went on, and so did John Birkin. Death was near, he could feel it, deep down. Not the fairy tale death he told young Billy about. That was just a story to entertain him. This was true death. Eternal. Billy knew more about it now than John did, anyway.</p>
                    <p>It didn't come as a surprise when the floor in the hall began to creak. Soon, a figure stood above John’s bedside. John looked up.</p>
                    <p>“Hello.” He said.</p>
                    <p>HELLO. Replied Death.</p>
                    <p>“I- I guess it’s time to go now, isn't it?”</p>
                    <p>ARE YOU AFRAID?</p>
                    <p>“No. I've lived a good life. If I may ask, what’s there . . . in the afterlife that is.”</p>
                    <p>I DO NOT KNOW.</p>
                    <p>“I thought so. Is there time for me to say goodbye?”</p>
                    <p>MAKE YOUR PEACE, BUT LET US GO.</p>
                    <p>John put his hand to his side and gripped the feeble wrist beside him.</p>
                    <p>“See you soon, honey.”</p>
