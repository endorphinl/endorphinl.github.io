                    <p>Let us look back into hisotry and ponder upon the numerous rises and falls of great empires and civilizations. Now if we reflect upon it, the rise of a civilization and the fall of the other is simultaneous and in a sense due to factors such as nationalism or dispute over land or over proving ones god's superiority over the other. In all this, however, we observe the rise and fall of cultures, of languages, of cuisines, of clothings, of traditions and most importantly of knowledge. But is it really the fall of the other? Is it not that one civilizations knowledge and behaviors influence the new-coming empire? I think it is so. May it be through trade or through forced influences resulted from conflicts, civilizations are influenced. And it is through such fall and rise that evolution of knowledge and tradition is achieved. Now, let us look at us. We tend to refer 'constant character' as a virtue and a practice to be admired. However, is it not perhaps natural and preferable to change? Us being influenced by our surroundings is not something to be frowned upon. We as individuals are like civilizations falling and rising as we move to different countries or make new friends. These are all civilizations within us that rise and fall. It is perhaps through this mixture of civilizations that we achieve our character and form ourselves. It is through  these by which we evolve oursleves.</p>
                    <p>So let us not be too afraid to notice a change in our slight accents or preferences in cuisine. It is simply our true character being in making.</p>
