                    <p>can it be said that ones reactions to events are good indications of ones depth in character? well I came to think that it may perhaps be so as a result of ones inclination to read or, rather, to watch movies or tv shows.</p>
                    <p>To compare books and movies, it is certainly an indisputable fact that books develop more depth in characters than movies. this is because books dont really have a limit in time where as movies do have time limits as audiences must be entertained for no longer than their impatience to sit still. (the culture of movie. perhaps i can talk more about why movies have limitations but books do not. how movie cultures have developed to be what it is now. is there any problems with the contemporary movies adopting stories from books. does this cause a drought in movie oriented plot ideas)Hence, children or young adults who watch movies frequently are exposed to the 2D characters and their reactions to events. Perhaps a close friend has passed away and actors show a certain degree of mourning and despair, but that can only be done to a certain length. but in books, for example, Raskolnikov's despair, guilt and disgust after his murder of the old lady in crime and punishment is profound in character. The length itself is about 100 pages. thats simply his despair, theres so much more which shows his recovery, self realization. (Perhaps such a conclusion in itself is also a good representation of my ideologies of human beings. The argument that I am presenting in itself is under the assumption that human beings are not capable of genuine reactions and emotions and that they simply imitate someone who is within the 0.1% of whom are capable of genuine emotions. maybe people arent influenced so much by books or movies but rather are simply showing their best emotions to events)</p>
                    <p>Now if children and young adults are more inclined to read books than watch movies, then they would in a sense be subconsciously effected by the reactions and would naturally have depth in their own character/personality. Now i must say i am reflecting upon myself and i for one have a shallow characteristic. I envy Daniel Han for his ingenuity and depth in character. For me, if I were to be confronted by events which are overwhelming, I would certainly be more inclined to show no emotions or try to be resolute and firm, unwavering just like heroes and protagonists in movies do to add an effect of dramatization. However, people who have enjoyed reading books from young age, would be more inclined to show 'true' emotions whether it be something drawn from their subconscious or something one experiences truly as they perceive the event, we cannot know for sure. But the differences in reactions to events must be some indication of differences which surpass the simple differences in personalities between people.</p>
