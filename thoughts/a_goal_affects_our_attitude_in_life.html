                    <p>Perhaps having a goal in life is a factor which affects our attitude in life. let us consider this goal as a materialistic goal rather than a reputational or intellectual goal. The author has not yet pondered on the affects of other goals.</p>
                    <p>If one has a materialistic goal, despite having firm virtues in life, one may be more inclined to bear the pain and stress of momentarily forget ones virtues. This would all be to obtain this goal.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if one were to not have a goal, then perhaps a 'default' goal would be to live the moment happily, to live as they wish. The absence of a long term goal results in a default short term goal, momentary happiness. Thus one would be more inclined to ignore orders from elders or higher ranked officials</p>

                    <p>But perhaps its not a matter of short or long term goals but rather a matter of level of desperation</p>
