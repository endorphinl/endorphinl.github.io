                    <p>why did i choose to not cancel the dinner? well, certainly i am more appealed to learning and in such youthful mentality, i prefer cancelling and staying to work more. I do indeed love working. However, it is a matter of priorities. perhaps one may look at me and judge that social life or friends are a priority against work to me. But how naive and shallow minded of them to not be able to see life in a self maturing/ self realizing journey but see life simply as nonconsecutive pieces of events only affecting their mere enjoyment. no, not at all indeed. even in such mindset, work may be of a higher priority to me than social gatherings; however, focus should not be in the fact that i chose gathering over work, it should be focused on the fact that i did not cancel an appointment, a promise between two human beings. it is a matter of respect, honesty and values which i uphold. I would rather much stay working than talking to old friends of mine, but breaking a promise is of greater seriousness than work or gathering.</p>
