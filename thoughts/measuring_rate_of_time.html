                    <p>How do we know how fast time is moving? I haven't wanted to ask this question here because I don't even really understand how to phrase it. I understand that seconds, minutes, etc, were created by us to measure time. But, how do we know that time is always moving that fast? I mean, I've heard stuff like if you travel faster than the speed of light that time slows down. If that happened, would a clock move slower? Would you move slower? Would you be aware that you were moving slower?</p>
                    <p>Basically, I do not understand how time works. When I think about it too long it literally makes my head hurt. I don't understand how we measure something when we don't know how fast it's moving.</p>

                    <p>Time is relative, so to understand the passage of time you have to be at least vaguely familiar with Special Relativity. There is an equation of the form t=γ(t0), where γ=1/sqrt[1-(v^2/c^2)] where v is the velocity of the observer and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation describes the phenomenon referred to as time dilation. As you can see from the equation, the perceived time, t, changes as your speed changes (t0, however, never changes as it is the time in reference frame where the observer is not moving). The twin paradox is often brought up in discussions of time dilation. It's important to note, however, that you have to be moving really fast for the effects of time dilation to matter at all--even at 10% of the speed of light, time only appears to speed up by about 0.5%. However, even at 99.999% the speed of light the observer doesn't notice a difference--to them it still feels like a year has passed even though some one in the rest frame has experienced 223.6 years. This is actually the basis of the Queen song '39.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting time related phenomenon is gravitational time dilation. Not only does time change with velocity, it changes with the magnitude of applied gravitational force. Basically, a clock at sea level will run slower than one that is several thousand feet above sea level (although this effect is on the scale of 10-9 seconds, so a person in an airplane and a person in the ocean would have essentially the same perception of the passing of time).</p>
