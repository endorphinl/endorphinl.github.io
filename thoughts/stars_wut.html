                    <p>There was me and him left.  I said to him, "she just called us'stars'? And as we were leaving said 'bye'". And he said "no way" and I said "that's so weird. It's like a car coming at you at full throttle all the way up to you and then past you and you have to walk all the way back with your dog to get into the car. It's just like that!" Then he said, "yeah exactly".</p>
