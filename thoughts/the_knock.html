                    <p>A gentleman with a magician hat and in black suit visit a house in a very well mannered fashion. Knock on the door and as the door opens he never fails to give a subtle bow to show his respect and the tenant gives a reaction to his visit, whether it be of surprise, collapse with tears, acceptance of ones time with a subtle smile, denial, anger or perhaps even happiness that everything is over (maybe life was too stressful). And in the end it ends with the man knocking the a door and no one answers so he opens the door, gives his subtle bow but doesnt go up. And as the camera zooms out there is a lady who hung herself. Our reactions to death</p>
