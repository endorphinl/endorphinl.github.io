                    - use the jp calendar in an independent environment. (outside of jp website or get rid of all headers and footers)</br>
                    - use it as a scheduler to present the next projects that are coming up</br>
                    - explain each project vaguely</br>
                    - show this (The Engine -> BRUCE -> XXXX -> Project X -> Project Y)</br>
                    - on the above slide, pause, think, then continue "now, many of you may have wondered in the beginning of the presentation, what is that scheduler that he's using. it has that familiar green color"</br>
                    - I present to you our very next innovation, The Jobplanet Calendar.</br>
                    - it is an independent calendar module.</br>
                    - our plan is to make the calendar so independent that it can be used by the users, as their own scheduler.</br>
                    - we will first add the recruitment dates on the calendar, it will then move on to become a personalized calendar. users will be able to add their own interviews onto the calendar.</br>
