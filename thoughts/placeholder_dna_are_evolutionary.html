                    <p>what if the reason why there are so many dna sequences that we still havent figured out the purpose is because the purpose to not produce anything. the sequences wont create enzymes. their purpose is to be a buffer to reduce the chances of messing up an important part of a sequence.</p>
                    <p>this all is under one assumption. it is the assumption that the errors in dna duplication are due to a physical limitation of dna. now this means that dna has a physical nature which results in an inevitable fault during the replication. so what happened during evolution is that initially we would have had only the essential sequences but the errors in replication would kill us easily. then anomalies arose. some humans would put rubbish in between. it wouldve started with 2 or 3 rubbish sequences. and so now these himans have a lesser chance in having a fault in the essebtial sequence. this then goes on and on and we evolve to our current selves that have a shit ton of rubbish sequences to reduce the risk to a minimal.</p>
