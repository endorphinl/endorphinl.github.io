                    <p>I put this as a tip because my instinct is to defend my views with facts rather than questions and I need to constantly work at this.</p>
                    <p>Humans are egocentric and we don't usually contradict the data we generate from our own mind. Therefore, when persuading someone of a particular course of action, do not set it up as a you vs me debate. Rather, ask good questions that get the other person to think through all the options. By portraying yourself as a curious individual who wants truth rather than an enemy to be fought against, you can collaboratively find answers rather than become opponents.</p>
