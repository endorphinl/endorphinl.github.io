                    - BRUCE has three components. 1. Parser 2. Loader 3. Renderer</br>
                    - the parser is the part of BRUCE that deals with the queries our users submit.</br>
                    - the loader is in charge of loading the right data sets into the system</br>
                    - the renderer will then render the knowledge panel with the data</br>
                    - now, the most important part of BRUCE is its capability to understand the search queries. BRUCE can understand the meanings in the texts. I would like to invite up our very own YJ to explain the parser.</br>
                    - yj explains how the parser works</br>
                    - thank you</br>
                    - hk explains how the loader works</br>
                    - hk explains how the renderer works</br>
                    - hk explains bruce.think and bruce.draw - think is just loading the data.</br>
                    - think is there for multi purposes. we want to be able to dynamically change our panels. Our mobile web might have a different panel design from the desktop version.</br>
                    - so we want to be able to isolate just the data so we can customize.</br>
                    - but most importantly, our main means of communication with our mobile app is JSON, hence, 'think' is a perfect way to communicate.</br>
