                    <p>So this is a bit of an odd question, but lets say I were an engineer at NASA in the 60s and needed to calculate something like âˆš(3.4689) or Cos(0.488); what would be the fastest and most reliable way of figuring these numbers by hand? I understand how Taylor and Maclaurin series work, but that seems very slow. I also understand how slide rules work and how those would be helpful, but what would be a reasonable time to expect from a skilled engineer in this era? a few seconds or so?</p>


                    <p>They had big tables with values of standard functions (eg the classic Abramowitz and Stegun), and better knowledge of basic algebra to make small calculations quickly.</p>
                    <p>Also, an interesting factoid: they used to determine integrals by drawing the function, cutting it out, and thenweighing the paper. Pretty clever.</p>
                    <p>If the integral of a function is the area under the curve, then if they cut out this area and knew the thickness and density of the paper they were using they could estimate the area.</p>
