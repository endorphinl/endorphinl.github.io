                    <p>It is NOT instantaneous, best estimates show it is very near the speed of light, and most likely is exactly the speed of light. One could ask "does it slow down in media with a slower speed of light, like glass?" AFAIK, we don't know. It's a good question.</p>
                    <p>Gravity is fantastically difficult to measure. Attempts to measure its speed have gone all over the place, historically. Only recently do we have good confidence in the "speed-of-light, or approximately that" estimate.</p>
                    <p>Where could it come from? Planetary orbits. Not only does the Moon orbit the Earth, but the Earth orbits the Moon as well- but since the ratio is so imbalanced, the elliptical path the Earth takes due to the Moon's gravity is small, its radius is smaller than the Earth's physical radius.</p>
                    <p>It does "matter" on this scale, when we have 2 objects orbiting one another, both are in motion, let's say 10 light-minutes away from each other. Is Body A attracted to where Body B is at that moment, or where Body B was 10 minutes ago? This is a real effect, but unfortunately too small to reliably measure. The Moon is only 1.26 light-seconds from the Earth, its effect on the weight of objects on the Earth's surface and the resulting acceleration is VERY small, and the Moon moves very little in 1.26 seconds. So hanging a weight, and seeing where it hangs after subtracting the Earth's gravity vector would theoretically give the vector to the Moon and you could see if it points to the center of where the Moon is now, or where it was 1.26 seconds ago- but in reality it's far too small to measure.</p>
                    <p>The current estimates came from the orbital decay of binary pulsars- whose physics are beyond my capability to understand, but that's were speed of gravity became a macroscopically measurable thing. The math was crunched and it came out to within 1% of the speed of light</p>
