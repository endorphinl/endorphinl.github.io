                    <p>The main character would be going in a journey across past and present to ultimately find out that he is not human anymore but robot. And as game progresses, subtle clues are given to show this or per say in the beginning "unnecessary" things point to him being a robot. Also when main character is in past different subtle cues are given abt him being human.</p>

                    <p>Also maybe incorporate death of wife/girlfriend to be the turning point or the spark, that makes him or forces him to become robot</p>

                    <p>He is only a robot part of a huge system</p>

                    <p>Or the ultimate result of changing the past through the game converges to him as a robot in present. So the changes he unknowingly make to what he thinks he is trying to get by changing, is actually in reality making him a robot</p>
