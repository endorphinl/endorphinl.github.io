                    <p>What causes us to transition from conscious to unconscious, in the context of falling to sleep? For example, right now I am feeling really tired, I'm yawning like crazy, but when I close my eyes, nothing happens</p>

                    <p>Great question! As you close your eyes and start falling asleep, the electrical firing patterns in your brain change progressively. During the first step of your sleep cycle, your brain is full of beta-waves, which are the waves that are normally fired when you are awake and just going about your business during the daytime. When you close your eyes but are still awake, there is actually a change in electrical activity in your brain from beta waves to alpha waves. Thus, you may think that nothing happens when you close your eyes, but actually if you're tired and keep your eyes closed long enough, you will eventually fall asleep. Afterwards, you go into progressively deeper and deeper sleep stages (Stages N1, N2, and N3) until you reach REM sleep, where you dream and have memory consolidation. During the last N3 stage, your brain is firing very low frequency delta waves. While this is happening, there is a shift in balance of the chemicals in your brain (i.e. neurotransmitters). There are more inhibitory neurotransmitters than excitatory neurotransmitters. These inhibitory neurotransmitters (like GABA) pretty much cause your brain to slow down. Finally, there is a huge role played in sleep by the hypothalamus (which helps regulate your light-day circadian rhythm) and the reticular activating system of the brainstem (which helps with arousal and loss of consciousness patterns). Put simply, there is a huge interplay between all these centers of the brain, which eventually causes us to go to sleep. It's a concept that is still not well understood, even in the science community, because we simply don't fully understand how the brain completely works. I'm sorry I could not give you a better answer, but that in of itself is a reflection of how little we know about sleep, since it is one of the most mysterious aspects of the brain.</p>
