                    <p>Its just a curious thought which stems from my observations of an old hispanic lady strolling with her friend in korea. Well to be precise, it was her paper bag which caused this thought. When I gave a glance at her, I most certainly saw her first, as in not her clothes or her paper bag or her hair. Which means that I was focusing on her human qualities before noticing her exterior decors. Now it just may be so because she was a foreigner in korea, but perhaps we see a person in the way the person expresses themselves, we see their values which are shown through their actions. So I mean to say is that she does not value so much her looks as her qualities. On the other hand, if it were to be a korean lady walking down, I wouldve noticed her huge shopping bag that she so pompously wouldve displated, I wouldve seen her not so elegently worn clothes. I wouldnt have seen her as a human with character but more a shell like a mannequin with general human qualities. I wouldnt want to get to know the lady.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps these are all just delusions trying to justify my observations as others' faults or others' responsibility to portray themselves in certain manners. However, it may all be for naught and there may be a much simpler explanation: I am a shallow bastard.</p>
