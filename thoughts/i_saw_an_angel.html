                    <p>There is a particular story in my short 20years of life which I would like to share. It was at a volunteer station when I was in highschool. Although one may say that I was too young to have come to realize values orin a greater sense the meaning of life, I believe it was a life changing experience. I volunteered at the RDA partly because horses were mammals whose magestice build always facinated me. The idea of the program was that horse-back riding stimulates similar muscles as ones involved in walking, thereby helping disabled children to gradually learn to walk. We used to call our respective disabled children our "partner". My partner was Jeremiah and he was diagnosed with '....'. One day Jeremiah didnt show up for riding and i learned that he has been hospitalized. So i gave him a visit. There I saw a child with disgusting numbers of injections. Despite the haunting numbers of syringes, I did not see a helpless child. I only saw a 'full of joy' child.  ..... he would be in his bed wanting to see the outside. I would be out of this alcohol stenching bulding in an hour and taking my life for granted. I would be taking my college life for granted. I could not hide my embarrassment to have lived life with unsatisfactory attitude. Though it was my duty to perhaps be a model to him, my wrongly disadvatanged partner has taught me the ever-smiling attitude which I take so dearly now to perhaps provide more happiness to this world and to Jeremiah.</p>
