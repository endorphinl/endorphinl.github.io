                    <p>No, I believe in manifestation of love. Love is not a definitive thing. It is the manjfestation of love which we perceive as love. Love doesnt exist. Only the manifestation of it. Which is in line with the idea that the definition of love is different for everyone. A show of total submission can be a manifestation of love. Respect for the partner is a manifestation of love. Yielding is a manifestation of love. Love doesnt exist. It is these manifestations that we believe to be the definition if love. Perhaps when people say that they have found the true meaning of love, they have, in fact, found their way of manifesting love</p>
