                    <p>This may sound like a stoner question, but how does energy know that a circuit has been completed? Also, can the concept of "Grounding" be explained please? How does grounding work on free-floating bodies? (Airplanes/Satellites)</p>

                    <p>How does water know a tap has been opened? Current flows when it can because it can.</p>
                    <p>Right, but what is causing the flow? It's a potential. In the case of flowing water, high pressure flows spontaneously to lower pressure. Water in the faucet is at a higher pressure than the atmosphere, so when the faucet is opened, the water "sees" a lower pressure and flows.</p>
                    <p>I believe voltage is the equivalent of pressure . The more voltage the higher the flow of electrons.</p>
