                    <p>Well it doesn't, there's a speed-of-light delay which is mostly cancelled (unless the source is moving very fast) by the fact that the gravitational field is velocity-dependent.</p>
                    <p>However, before any of this was known, it was possible to consider what effect a speed of propagation for Newtonian gravity would have on the stability of solar system, and it was found that this speed had to exceed 10 billion times the speed of light, or else planetary orbits would be unstable. This was evidence that Newtonian gravity was effectively instantaneous.</p>
                    <p>As I alluded to in the first sentence, gravity is not Newtonian.</p>
                    <p>A good reference is by Carlip in Physics Letters A, a free version is here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9909087.pdf</p>


                    <p>Can you elaborate on what you mean by "the gravitational field is velocity-dependent" ? The ArXiV paper is a little dense for the non-physicist.</p>

                    <p>Think of it this way.</p>
                    <p>When we see a distant body moving away from us, we can tell it's moving away because a photon that reaches us is red-shifted.</p>
                    <p>The photon is red shifted because the reference frame from where it was emitted was different than where it was detected, and it is different in that it was traveling at some velocity away from the detector.</p>
                    <p>Now the photon is a force carrier for the EM force, and we can model how this works a bit better than we can gravitational force.</p>
                    <p>So if we're 5 lightyears away from something, does it "know" that we're moving apart, and send us a redshifted photon? No, it just sends out a photon, but the fact that the photon transitions from matter in one frame of reference to be detected in another, the result is, in the case of the photon, a change in the energy received. If in the interim we accelerated to the same reference frame and then detected it, it wouldn't be redshifted.</p>
                    <p>The gravitational force has a similar mechanism. If two objects are traveling relative to each other, when the gravitational force is felt, it is felt differently depending on the difference between the frame of reference that the force was generated around, and the frame of reference that the force affects.</p>
                    <p>So in the same way, if you feel gravity from a body moving 50km/s away from you, if that takes 60 seconds to reach you, you will feel a force as if it's applied by a body 3000km away from the position that it originally was sent out. If in that 60 seconds the body was moved off course, it wouldn't "correct" the "prediction".</p>
                    <p>Similarly, if within that 60 seconds you were to accelerate to match reference frame of the body that emitted it, we would feel the force as though it hadn't moved. If we accelerated away so that our difference in velocity was higher, we'd feel the force as though it was from a body even further away when it finally hit us.</p>
                    <p>There's no information being transferred except for the state of the body when the force started to propagate from it. In the same kind of way that the photon doesn't "know" before hand whether it's going to be redshifted or blueshifted, it's just the result of being detected in a different frame of reference from where it was emitted.</p>

                    <p>I think what the user meant by velocity-dependent is that it is dependent on the frame of reference. so in other words, a simpler phrase for frame of reference is velocity-dependent.</p>
                    <p>If an object A is moving at 20km/h, everything that the object experiences is dependent on that factor, whether it be time, or the speed at which another object B cruising on its side at 30km/h(to a stationary observer) seems to it as moving at 10km/h. so that is its frame of reference. and another object  C moving at 50km/h has a different frame of reference. however, an object D moving at 30km/h is in the exact same frame of reference as object A. now, a "frame of reference" is NOT a physical attribute of this universe. It is simply a way physicists have come to understand the fact that a moving object perceives things differently from a stationary object.</p>
