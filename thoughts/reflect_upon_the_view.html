                    <p>I reflect upon the view down the street of three cross sections. Perhaps it is the sunlight that affects me or perhaps it is just a passing thought. But everytime I look down the street, I realize life is so light. Life is so unfair. Life is full of people including myself denying the ever present end that we shall all greet. Denial of the day might be our best solution, if not, what can we do to comprehend the notion that we are only here on earth for as long as a fraction of the cosmic history. How can we live on after comprehending that all the technologies and great  civilizations we have built are simply our effort to build a wall around us from that day that will come inevitably to all of us. Perhaps it is an alteration of the question "what is our purpose". But as Bill Nye has said, "Not knowing something is not a pall on your identity. It is, in fact, how you handle not knowing something that informs your identity more than anything else.</p>
                    <p>Embrace the unknown, to not fear failure". Dont build a wall around yourself,  embrace the unknown and accept your worth in this world. Accept that you may perhaps leave a mark in the history of the rock that we so desperately want to believe to be special</p>
