                    <p>Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the importance of simplicity in software. I can remember a time in my career when I considered a single system that does everything to be ideal; I dreamed of building monolithic applications that met every possible need my users may have, and I searched for all-encompassing frameworks that eliminated the need for any other dependencies and abstracted away as many challenges as possible. Why import several small libraries into my application when I could adopt a framework that has everything included?</p>
                    <p>As time has passed and I've written more software, though, I have come to realize what so many programmers figured out before me: software works best when it focus on doing one thing well. And the corollary: software that tries to do too many things will not excel at all of them.</p>

                    <p>I'll tell you folks one little secret which we all know, but no one seems to say it out loud.</p>
                    <p>Simple software is possible only in retrospective, after you've written some complex software.</p>
                    <p>It's easy to want a focused, elegant library that does X, but the problem is we don't know how to precisely define X where the focus should go before we dabble with it, play with it, see what matters, what doesn't (often not what we thought), experience pain and joy in production, refactor it, throw some of it away, wake up one day with a bright idea and so on.</p>
                    <p>So making things simple means we need to make them complex first, so we can feel in our gut where simplicity lies.</p>
                    <p>If you try to make things simple from the very beginning, you'll end up either stuck in analysis paralysis, or end up producing a very "simple" and very useless piece of software. Lots of iteration, feedback, experience and willing to take a few steps back, throw some code away and take a new path is key.</p>
