when rejoin-stack.sh, in c-vol
ERROR cinder.service [-] Manager for service cinder-volume is reporting problems, skip sending heartbeat. Service will appear "down".
create instance with respective flavor
create volume matching flavor (devstack default volume backing size is 5GB) - volume backing size? does it have to match?
attach volume to instance
can’t use setup ISO as a boot image for instances because, whenever the instance restarts, it will go through the OS setup steps. Hence, we need to use image builder to build the basic image with components that are independent of hardware (http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/ - get cloud image at the top. ignore overwhelming amazon ec2 published list) - after OS setup, cant you just load from the volume next time instead of using boot image again?
