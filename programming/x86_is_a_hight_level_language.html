                    <p>That distinction doesn't really matter in this context though. Rob isn't just playing word games. Rob breaks crypto for a living, so all of this is in the context of sidechannel attacks. To prevent side channel attacks, all crypto operationsmust be constant time (or else getting the 3rd character wrong in a password might take a shorter amount of time to return than getting the 8th character wrong). People think that by doing constant time operations, they are avoiding the pitfalls of compiler optimizations, and he's pointing out that even if you hard code in the operations, you can still be exposed by the optimizations done by the processor itself.</p>
                    <p>These discrepancies may very well allow an attacker on AWS steal SSL keys from other instances running on the same machine.</p>

                    <p>- I've been thinking about this for a while; How there's physically no way to get lowest-level machine access any more. It's strange.</p>
                    <p>-At this point the machine-code language for x86 is mostly just still there for compatibility. It's not practical to change the machine-code language for x86, the only real option for updating is to add new opcodes. I bet that if you go back to the 8086, x86 machine code probably maps extremely well to what the CPU is actually doing. But, at this point CPU's are so far removed from the 8086 that newer Intel CPU's are basically just 'emulating' x86 code on a better instruction set. The big advantage to keeping it a secret instruction set is that Intel is free to make any changes they want to the underlying instruction set to fit it to the hardware design and speed things up, and the computer won't see anything different.</p>
