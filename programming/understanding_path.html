                    <p>Before we go any further, I have to stop and talk a while about paths. When you type in the name of a command, the system does not search the entire computer to find where the program is located. That would take a long time. You have noticed that you don't usually have to specify a complete path name to the program you want to run, the shell just seems to know.</p>
                    <p>Well, you are right. The shell does know. Here's how: the shell maintains a list of directories where executable files (programs) are kept, and just searches the directories in that list. If it does not find the program after searching each directory in the list, it will issue the famous command not found error message.</p>
                    <p>This list of directories is called your path. You can view the list of directories with the following command:</p>

                    <p># echo $PATH</p>
