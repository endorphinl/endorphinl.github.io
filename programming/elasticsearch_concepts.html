                    <p>- review include elastic_review</p>
                    <p>- elastic_review include elastic_common</p>
                    <p>- elastic_common has a default reindex_all and reindex</p>
                    <p>- reindex_all is to create an index with data that is not in the form of elasticsearch index</p>
                    <p>- reindex is to add one data into existing index</p>
                    <p>- other search methods are created appropriate to uses</p>

                    <p>- elasticsearch has an analyzer attached</p>
                    <p>- the analyzer is a plugin that tokenizes strings in a certain way</p>
                    <p>- the logic part is all in the search query, just like how relational db works (one's search query determines whether you want a ranking or a grouping in mysql)</p>
