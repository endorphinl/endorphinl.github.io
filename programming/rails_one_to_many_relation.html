                    1. 'has_many :spices' in food model</br>
                    2. 'belongs_to :food' in spices model (grammar matters! singular when belonging to one)</br>
                    3. add new column 'food_id' to the table that 'belongs_to'(spice)</br>
                    4. edit view of spices. account for addition of new column</br>
                    5. take note that perhaps it is useful to use a 'select' in '_form' when choosing food because otherwise it will show the food_id which are integers</br>
                    6. edit 'index.html' to however one wants to display</br>
                    7. edit 'show.html' to however one wants to display the additional info</br>
                    8. edit 'show.html' of foods to however one wants to display. no need to do the steps done before as those steps already accomplishes the connection between spices and foods.</br>
