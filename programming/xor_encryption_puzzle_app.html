                    <p>Xor encryption/puzzle app</p>
                    <p>- timer for hint push</p>
                    <p>- its like instant messaging, but its encrypted.</p>
                    <p>- and it works because only the messenger and receiver knows the password</p>
                    <p>- itd be just like any chat apps, but in the inputs, you type in your message and there is another small box, like the unix github password box, for the key.</p>
                    <p>- received msgs can be 'select all' decrypt using one key. But there might be some msgs in between that were encrypted using a different key. Then long tap the bubble and put in decrypt key.</p>
