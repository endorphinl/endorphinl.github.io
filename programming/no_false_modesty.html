                    <p>Does Git last forever, or do you foresee another revision control system in another 10 years? Will you be the one to write it?</p>
                    <p>Torvalds: I'm not going to be the one writing it, no. And maybe we'll see something new in ten years, but I guarantee that it will be pretty "git-like." It's not like git got everything right, but it got all the really basic issues right in a way that no other SCM had ever done before.</p>
